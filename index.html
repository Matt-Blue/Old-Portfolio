              My greatest passion is skiing.  The adrenaline rush of flying down the mountain at speeds you're not even allowed to drive at, or jumping off cliffs that were taller than I cannot be found elsewhere.  This being said, I found a much more safe option to get my thrill; programming.  Although it can never replace skiing, I get a huge thrill every time some functionality falls into place.

              <br><br>I’ve been studying Spanish for over 9 years now.  It started as a useful skill learned in school, and has developed into a great appreciation for not only the language, but also the culture.

              <br><br>My modern form of art is creating websites.  Despite this, my mother, a graduate from Indiana University with a Bachelor of Arts degree, did not hesitate to get my into art as soon as possible.  Since I was little I’ve experimented with every mode of art from painting to sculpting to photography, but I enjoy colored pencils the most.  This is because they allow me to create precise detail while giving me complete creative control.  To see my best artwork, click <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#artwork"><u>here</u></a>.
              <br><br>One element of my personality that truly defines me is my selflessness.

              <br>Sixth grade was the first time I was allowed to select an elective.  Most of the guys wanted to take shop, most girls wanted to take home economics, me on the other hand, I wanted to learn something advanced that I could use in the real world; Spanish.  Throughout Middle and High School I took Spanish every year, and this led up to my senior year.  
              <br><br>I moved from Colorado to Florida during the Summer before my senior year, and upon entering my new high school experienced a large culture shock.  In Colorado, Spanish class meant a handful of non-fluent speakers learning from a fluent teacher.  In Florida, Spanish class meant a handful of fluent Spanish speakers, a fluent Spanish teacher, and myself.  The culture in Florida is much more diverse and the latino culture specifically is very prominent.  Despite this large culture shock, I persevered and learned much more culture and native dialect because of it.  
              <br><br>Since high school I have taken Spanish almost every year, and have completed the requirements for my Spanish minor.  Moving forward I hope to translate my skills to the professional world and utilize my abilities to bridge cultural and language barriers.

                    In my senior year of high school I bacame an assistant to the special education program.
                    With my help, one of the girls, Mary, ended up leaving the class because she advanced to the next level of the program. 
                    Working with them helped me gain a complete understanding of just how lucky I am to be me and also how kind and compassionate other people can be. 
                    In the end these kids were the nicest I have ever had the pleasure to work with.

                    Every Wednesday from 5-10pm I went, rather with friends or alone, to the Vineyard Church to serve food to the less fortunate. 
                    The first task at hand was always to roll silverware and set up tables and chairs in preparation for dinner. 
                    Second we organized groceries into packages which would be distributed to the attendees after dinner. 
                    Third we were in charge of serving dinner, which was made by other volunteers, to the people who were already seated throughout the service area in the church. 
                    After serving dinner we always went out and sat with the people we served food to and tried to have quality conversations with them. 
                    During this time the pastor would do his sermon for the day as we ate and listened. Afterwards we went back into the kitchen and started to grab grocery bags for distribution. 
                    Once all the bags were given out, the work was done and all that was left to do was talk with all those still there at that point, play with the kids, and go home. 
                    Although it was a lot of work, the happiness of the kids as they played, the gratitude of the people we served, and the joy of the other volunteers made the experience very enjoyable and rewarding.

                    Every month, the brothers of my fraternity go out to SW 34th Street in Gainesville FL with orange jackets, reachers, and trash bags to go pick up trash on the side of the road. 
                    Every cleanup we fill up about two full trash bags with items that have been irresponsibly thrown out of the windows of cars onto the side of the road. 
                    Out in the sun every first Sunday of the month is not a fun job, neither is picking up bags of dog waste, beer bottles, and any other lovely items we happen to come across. 
                    It saddens me how much trash is just thrown onto the side of the road, but knowing I have other people that will help me better society gives me hope and drives me to keep giving back.

                    Both of these events were projects that I led to raise money for S.O.S. Children's Villages. 
                    For S.O.S. Smash we got a car donated from a local towing company, spray painted it with FSU colors (to incite the rivalry), and allowed people to smash it with a sledge hammer in our main plaza.
                    We got featured in UF's newspaper, The Alligator, and raised over $250 in one day.  
                    Shave to save was another event we threw in which we put our heads up for sale; litterally.
                    The person with the most money put towards their name was to get their head shaved, and if we hit our goal all of us were to shave our heads.
                    We did not reach our goal, however we still raised over $300 in one week.
